## Reporting security problems in the PsyOptions PsyAmerican Repository

**DO NOT CREATE A GITHUB ISSUE** to report a security problem.

Instead please use this [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/mithraiclabs/psyoptions/security/advisories/new) link.
Provide a helpful title and detailed description of the problem.

If you haven't done so already, please **enable two-factor auth** in your GitHub account.

Expect a response as fast as possible in the advisory, typically within 72 hours.

--

If you do not receive a response in the advisory, send an email to
security@psyoptions.io with the full URL of the advisory you have created. DO NOT
include attachments or provide detail sufficient for exploitation regarding the
security issue in this email. **Only provide such details in the advisory**.
